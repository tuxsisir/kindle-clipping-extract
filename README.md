## Kindle MyClippings.txt export to jupyter notebook

Read books on Kindle? Highlight the texts and notes? Ocassionally, go through your highlighted texts?

You can make use of this notebook to overview your notes and highlights.

Personally, I maintain my notes on jupyter notebooks so this script basically extracts the notes from Kindle's `MyClippings.txt` and creates the file `[[book_name]].ipynb` and copies all the highlights as per book file.

#### Make sure to:

- `pip install tabulate` for viewing in tabular form within your notebook
